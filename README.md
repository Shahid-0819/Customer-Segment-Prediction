# Title of Project: Customer Segment Prediction for Code Clause
 
# Description:
In this project main aim to understand requirements of customer and solving them in easier way. I had used one Data Set from Kaggle.com which available publically you can download or use it from below mentioned link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shazebasad95/customer-segmentation 



# Specification of Dataset:-

This is part of a larger initiative to drive strategic shifts in the way the company segments its customers and allocates resources.

Some of the key questions that the company is trying to address in relation to its customer segmentation model are:

• Should we make a strategic shift in the segment lines to better capture the opportunity?
• Should we introduce a new segment or just make segment line adjustments?
• Any other shifts in the customer segmentation model that aren’t being considered?

# Additional Information:

The company currently segments its customers upmarket into three business lines, based on the Customer Fleet Size (CFS), or put another way - the number of vehicles in a customer’s entire fleet:

Commercial (CMRL)
• CFS of 20-50
• There are 15 CSMs based in their Philippines office

Mid-Market (MM)
• CFS of 51-500
• There are 10 CSMs based in Canada

Enterprise (ENT)
• CFS of over 500
• 4 CSMs

Although technically not part of the dataset, there is a fourth segment, called SMB:
• CFS of 1-19
• This segment does not have dedicated CSMs but instead have a team of 15 retention specialists who react to customer requests/cancellations, like a Support team
• This is the company’s largest segment and makes up roughly half of all revenue

The “Number of ELD Devices” field in the data represents the number of Electronic Logging Devices a customer has with the company. This is their core product and because this is a federally mandated product for trucking companies, every vehicle within a fleet should technically have an ELD

# Installation:
